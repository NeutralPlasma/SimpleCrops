seeds:

  # -> has the same properties as normal cactus, bamboo, sugarcane crop
  # -> currently doesnt work with pistons / autofarms (due to lag issues)
  #    will be fixed in next update.

    # Gain impacts how many drops you get from seed
    # bigger the gain more items it gives you
    # formula: basedrop amount + gain
    # example: you get 2 diamonds and seed gain is 5 you'll get 7 diamonds instead.
