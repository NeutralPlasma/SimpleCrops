# Seed types: item:MATERIAL, items:(item from items.yml), custom:(use ingame gui)
# If using seed-type ITEM, you cannot specify lore.
#
#
#

seeds:
  #
  # Multi block seeds (like cactus, bamboo, sugarcane...)
  # -> has the same properties as normal cactus, bamboo, sugarcane crop
  # -> currently doesnt work with pistons / autofarms (due to lag issues)
  #    will be fixed in next update.
  #
  multiBlock:
    seed-type: "ITEM:CACTUS" # Seed item that you place, can be changed.
    name: "&eExample MultiBlock" # Display name of the item
    dropNaturally: true # chance to drop upon breaking grass / tall grass
    duplicate: true # chance to drop 2 seeds when broken and fully grown (won't work on multi-block crops)
    duplicateChance: 25.0 # what's the chance to drop 2 seeds
    dropChance: 5.0 # Drop chance to drop from grass / tall grass

    #
    # Gain impacts how many drops you get from seed
    # bigger the gain more items it gives you
    # formula: basedrop amount + gain
    # example: you get 2 diamonds and seed gain is 5 you'll get 7 diamonds instead.
    #
    gain:
      min: 1
      max: 3
    #
    # Strength is value that impacts survival rate of crop when snipped with shears
    # percentage gets calculated from min-max dinamicaly
    #
    strength:
      min: 1
      max: 10
    #
    # Drops category of the crop
    # - item drops: Works with normal and multiblock crops
    # - command drops: Works with normal and multiblock crops
    # - block drops: Works with pumpkin/melon like crops
    # - structure drops: Works with tree like crops.

      commands:
        # Commands that get executed when someone harvests the crop
        # Valid placeholders that can be used
